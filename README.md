# DnD Sheets

This project creates enemy sheets used in [PythonDM](https://github.com/pnp-zone/DnD-Enemies/PythonDM)

1. Get the html files from [dnd-5e.herokuapp.com](https://dnd-5e.herokuapp.com/monsters/) by executing `download.sh`

2. Parse the html files into json files using `parse.py`

## Attention!

Some html files had to be altered. Currently the script will fail on the originals. Fix will be comming.
